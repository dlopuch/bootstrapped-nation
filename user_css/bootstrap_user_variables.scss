// Edit this file to include your brand-specific Bootstrap variable overrides or theme.
// This file gets fed into the NationBuilder Sass compiler, resulting in a Bootstrap build customized for your brand.
// See ./bootstrap.scss for details on build order.

// Refer to /bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/styleshseets/bootstrap/_variables.scss or
// Bootstrap themeing documentation for what you can specify here.

// Build notes:
// All files in this /user_css/ folder will be copied over into /dist/ by the Grunt build.  Feel free to @import
// anything you want (the NationBuilder Sass compiler will follow it), but remember that NationBuilder doesn't allow
// for subdirectories, so the file structure must be flat.


// Example theme overrides:
$brand-primary:         #600000; // Note that everything in the Bootstrap _variables.scss file use the "!default" flag,
$brand-success:         #78A830; // meaning they'll only use that value if the variable hasn't already been defined.
$brand-info:            #D8D860; // This user file is evaluated BEFORE the Bootstrap distro is, so by defining variables
$brand-warning:         #EEDE89; // like $brand-primary here, the Bootstrap distro values will be ignored.
$brand-danger:          #901800;
